# How to participate

There will be folders named `Week-1`, `Week-2` etc. To add your solution just submit a PR with you code to the corresponding week's folder. Please name your file like this: `preferredname-4.lean` if you are using Lean 4 or `preferredname-3.lean` if you are using Lean 3.

**Using Lean 4's FFI is forbidden. (Worried people will use C for code optimization)**
**Good Luck!**
