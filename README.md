# How to participate
There will be folders named `Week-1`, `Week-2` etc. Click the current on the one you want to solve. (Week order will be messed up due to how GitHub decides precendence).

Each folder will have a readme will have a `README.md` with the two challenges for that week. One will be a theorem proving problem, and the other a programming related question. 

To add your solution just submit a PR with you code to the corresponding week's folder. Please name your file like this: `preferredname-4.lean` if you are using Lean 4 or `preferredname-3.lean` if you are using Lean 3.

**Using Lean 4's FFI is forbidden. (Worried people will use C for code optimization)**
**Good Luck!**
