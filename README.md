# leandiscord-weekly
Weekly challenges for the Lean Discord Server.

# How to participate
There will be folders named `Week-1`, `Week-2` etc. Click the current on the one you want to solve. (Week order will be messed up due to how GitHub decides precendence).

Each folder will have a readme will have a `README.md` with the challenge for that week. To add your solution you must clone the repo, and submit a pr with your solution with a filename in the format of `preferred-name.lean`. Your file should have a comment at the top with your discord username and whether you are using Lean or Lean 4. (Lean may be better for some challenges because of mathlib). 

<b>Good Luck!</b>
