# Week 1

## Proving Question:

Prove that `n * (n + 1)` is the double of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (starting from 1).

## Programming Question:

Given a list of natural numbers, find the sum of the longest consecutive sublist of length greater than 1 that consists of consecutive ascending numbers. If there are more than one sublists with maximal length, return the sum of the first one. If there are none, return 0.

### Easier version:

Given a list of natural numbers, find the first adjacent pair of consecutive ascending numbers, and return their sum. If there are none, return 0.
