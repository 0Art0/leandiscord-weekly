# Week 3

## Programming question

Suppose A and B are subsets of the real line that are the unions of finitely many open intervals. Write an algorithm that takes in two lists of open intervals (representing A and B respectively) and outputs another list of intervals representing their intersection.

## Proving question

*Bonus:* Prove that your algorithm actually computes the intersection of the sets A and B.
